The platform allows medical professionals to upload multiple MRI scans simultaneously and receive a binary result indicating the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease. As part of a practical internship, this work is done by a pair of students.",
        "technicalDetailsTitle": "Technical Details",
        "technicalDetails": "Our project leverages machine learning techniques to assist doctors in diagnosing Parkinson's disease using MRI images. It uses the NTUA Parkinson’s Dataset. Before feeding the images into our models, we apply several preprocessing techniques to enhance their quality and make them more suitable for analysis, and then we train our model to learn the differences between healthy and Parkinson’s-affected brains."
