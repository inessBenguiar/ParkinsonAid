                Your privacy is important to us.
                At ParkinsonAid, we understand the importance of safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of the patients' medical information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect the data you submit through our platform, specifically tailored for healthcare professionals. By using ParkinsonAid, you agree to the collection and use of your data as described in this policy.</p>

                    <strong>1. Information We Collect:</strong><br />
                    We collect MRI images and related medical data solely for the purpose of providing AI-driven analysis to assist in detecting Parkinson's disease. This data is treated with the highest level of confidentiality and is not shared with third parties unless explicitly required by law.

                         - Assist in medical analysis through our AI model.<br />

                    We take data security seriously and implement industry-standard measures to ensure that all patient information and medical data are securely stored and processed. This includes encryption, access control, and regular security audits. However, no system is entirely immune to breaches, and while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
