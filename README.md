# 🧠 Parkinson Aid

## 📌 Overview

**Parkinson Aid** is a full-stack web application that assists doctors in diagnosing Parkinson’s disease through the analysis of MRI scans. The system integrates a deep learning model to classify medical images and provides an intuitive interface for doctors to manage diagnostics securely and efficiently.

> 🎓 This project was developed as part of a **summer internship** (3rd year) at the **Centre de Recherche sur l'Information Scientifique et Technique (CERIST)**.  
> 👥 Project developed by a team of two students.
